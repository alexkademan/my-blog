So, the point of this blog is to talk about whats going on with my work. As I become a better developer over time, I will share what I'm doing with the world through this website. Therefore, I expect the posts to be text heavy and sometimes include code snippets.

This is the type of thing that I'm talking about here....

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight scss %}
@mixin media-query($device) {
    @media screen and (max-width: $device) {
        @content;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

I'm only writing all of this here so that I have somethign to style as I build out the wireframe and site design.
